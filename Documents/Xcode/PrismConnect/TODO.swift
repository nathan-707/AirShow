 user connects -> clock sends current state

 // todo::
 make on connect the app successfully print out the state of the clock into compareable values.

 user changes setting -> app changes pending command to the clock, and app sets pending local varaible to the command.

 clock recieves command, sets pending mode to the command.

 clock then does what it needs to get to the mode requested.

 once clock detects that the current mode is now matched to the pending mode, resend clock state to app.

 app recieves state update -> app compares current state to pending mode it set, it will see that current mode now matches pending state.
